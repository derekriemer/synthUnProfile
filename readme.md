To build this addon, please visit [building.md]
SynthUnprofile allows you to make the synth settings ring back to what it should be, where the changes apply to NVDA's global config as it should, which is much more useful. 
To use, simply instal the addon, and use the synth settings ring as you'd use it normally.
There's one caviot, which is that it doesn't work with changing voice. This is complicated and I would have to hack nvda in a potentially harmful way to fix it.
It beeps at you if this change would modify the profile though.
